Irish Flower Classification using Logistic Regression

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn. It applies a logistic regression model with proper preprocessing, visualizations, and evaluation metrics.

Features

üå∏ Visualization of class distribution and feature correlation.

‚öôÔ∏è StandardScaler preprocessing.

üß† Logistic Regression model with O(log n) inference complexity.

‚úÖ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.

üíæ Model saved using joblib for portability.

How to Run

Install requirements using: pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

The trained model (.joblib) can be reused for predictions.

Requirements

See requirements.txt for necessary packages.
